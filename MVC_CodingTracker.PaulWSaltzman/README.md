# MVC Coding Tracker 

### Introduction 
Welcome to the world of Razor Pages! Razor pages is a “newer, simplified web application programming model. 
It removes much of the ceremony of ASP.NET MVC by adopting a file-based routing approach. Each Razor Pages file found under the Pages directory equates to an endpoint.” 
There’s a lot of discussion in the .NET world about the pros and cons of Razor Pages vs MVC. 
Here at the C# Academy, we will learn both design patterns, so you’re better prepared to get your first job and excel at it.

Another advantage of learning Razor Pages is that it uses Razor syntax, 
which is the same solution .NET uses for MVC and Blazor. That means that your knowledge will be applied in many different pieces of technology. 
If you’re hired to work with C#, you’ll most likely work with one of these at some stage. 
Even companies that use front-end frameworks such as Vue, React or Angular have applications using .NET front-end solutions as part of their domain. 
Your knowledge will go a long way.


### Requirements
