# Water Logger and Daily Calories

The project was created to learn about ASP.NET Core Razor Pages using a simple scenario as a business case. It also implements
simple js scripts and bootstrap styling.

## Notes

1. Razor syntax is used to embed .Net code into webpages, usually contained in files with extension .cshtml or .razor
2. @ is the symbol to switch from HTML to C#
3. Each Razor page contains a .cshtml file for page view and a .cshtml.cs file that handles page events as a PageModel.
4. The wwwroot folder contains static assets
5. The PageModel contains a dictionary ViewData to pass information to the view.
6. Tag Helpers are used to create HTML elements in razor files.
7. The DataAnnotations namespace provides built-in validation and formatting for models.
